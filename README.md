Project 1: Visualization of categorical/continuous variables.
Description: Data Generation: A random sample of 100 ages is created, ranging from 0 to 99 using NumPy's randint function.
Matplotlib Histogram: A histogram is plotted to show the frequency distribution of ages across 10 bins. The bars are colored blue with black edges for clarity, and a grid is added to improve readability.
Seaborn Histogram: A similar histogram is created using Seaborn's histplot, which includes a kernel density estimate (KDE) for a smoother representation of the age distribution. This adds visual appeal and highlights the underlying distribution more effectively.
Visual Insights: The Matplotlib plot provides a straightforward view of the age distribution, while the Seaborn plot enhances this with a smoother curve, offering deeper insights into the dataâ€™s distribution.

Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Description: Perform data cleaning and exploratory EDA on titanic dataset. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data. 
Conclusion: The exploratory data analysis reveals critical insights into the factors influencing survival on the Titanic. Key variables such as gender, passenger class, and age significantly impacted survival rates. This analysis highlights the need for further modeling to predict survival based on these variables and to explore additional relationships in the data.

Project 3: Analyze and Visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitude towards specific topics or brands.
Description: This code analyzes Twitter sentiment using NLTK's VADER tool. It processes tweets to extract sentiment scores, visualizes their distribution with a histogram, and displays average sentiment scores by topic in a bar plot, highlighting insights into various topics.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the sentiment analysis of Twitter data reveals valuable insights into public opinion across different topics. By employing NLTK's VADER tool, we effectively quantify and visualize sentiments, enabling a deeper understanding of how various subjects resonate with users. This analysis can inform decision-making and strategy development in areas such as marketing, public relations, and social research. Future work could explore sentiment trends over time or integrate additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
